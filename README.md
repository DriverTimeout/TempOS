# TempOS

TempOS is my custom OS meant for currently the raspberry pi 4. With the intentions of producing a productive environment for students/developers. My goal is to create my own custom OS to speed up processes, leaving only a minimalist yet highly functionaly environment. 

I'd also do documentation and provide a trail for others to commit to this project and hopefully draw more attention to minimalism. 

I'll be using buildroot to download the necessary packages to have an environment using i3blocks, with an emphais on using purely nvim bindings and i3 bindings to be purely badass and productive at the same time
